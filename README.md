# Introduction 

## 1. The Background of BlockEmulator


Initiated by **[HuangLab](http://xintelligence.pro/)**  (a research group in the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China), ***BlockEmulator** is a blockchain testbed that enables researchers to verify their proposed new protocols and mechanisms. It supports multiple consensus protocols and particularly the cross-shard mechanism.


The main purpose of this testbed is to help users (researchers, students, etc.) quickly verify their own blockchain consensus protocols and blockchain-sharding mechanisms. **BlockEmulator** is designed as an experimental platform that adopts lightweight system architecture.

It simplifies the implementation of industrial-class blockchains since **BlockEmulator** only implements the core functions of a blockchain, including the transaction pool, block packaging, consensus protocols, and on-chain transaction storage. It also supports common consensus protocols, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Work (PoW).

In particular, BlockEmulator offers the system-level design and implementation for blockchain sharding mechanisms. For example, the cross-shard transaction mechanisms implemented by BlockEmulator include the following two representative solutions, i.e., i) **Relay transaction mechanism** proposed by **Monoxide** (NSDI'2019), and the **BrokerChain** protocol proposed by **BrokerChain** (INFOCOM'2022).

BlockEmulator is oriented toward blockchain researchers because it provides a blockchain experimental platform for quickly implementing their own algorithms, protocols, and mechanisms. It also offers very helpful functions for researchers to help them collect experimental data, facilitating their plotting experimental figures.

This document aims to provide an easy-to-follow user manual of BlockEmulator.

## 3. Highlights of BlockEmulator:

1. **Lightweight**. BlockEmulator is a lightweight testbed platform for blockchain experiments.
2. **Fast Configuration**. BlockEmulator enables users to set up their environments quickly and supports remote deployment on Cloud.
3. **Customization**. BlockEmulator is implemented using Goland language, which supports users' customization and modification.
4. **Easy to Conduct Experiments**. BlockEmulator supports the playback of historical transactions of mainstream blockchains (such as Ethereum), as well as automatic output experimental log files. From those log files, researchers can interpret plenty of metrics such as system throughput, confirmation latency of transactions, the queueing of the transaction pool, etc. These features are very helpful for researchers and students to facilitate their experimental data collection and plotting of experimental charts.
